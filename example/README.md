The Research Software Directory (RSD) a content management system tailored to creating web pages that present Research Software. Our goal is to improve the findability and re-use of research software, show the impact this software has on research projects, 
and ensure that the people who are developing the software get credited for their work. 

The Research Software Directory:

1. presents research software alongside the context necessary for visitors to understand how the software can help them
1. makes scientific impact of research software visible in a qualitative way
1. provides automatically generated citation metadata in a variety of reference manager file formats, for easy citation
1. improves findability of software packages by applying Search Engine Optimization techniques such as schema.org metadata. This helps search engines understand what a given software package is about, thus improving ranking of search results
1. integrates with third-party services such as GitHub, GitLabs, Zenodo, CrossRef, DataCite, ORCID, ROR, etc.
