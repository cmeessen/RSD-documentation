# Introduction

Welcome to the user documentation of the [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org)!

Research software is one of the most important scientific instruments available today. Data-intensive research and computational simulation are the foundation of many scientific 
discoveries.

The Research Software Directory is content management system designed to show the impact research software has on research and society. We stimulate the reuse of research software 
and encourage proper citation of research software to ensure researchers and RSEs get credit for their work.

More information about the concepts behind the RSD can be found in this excellent 
[blog](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/the-research-software-directory-and-how-it-promotes-software-citation-4bd2137a6b8).
