# Adding a project

To add a project to your profile on the RSD, you can use the "+" button next to your profile button, on the top right of the page, and select "New Project" from the drop down menu.. 

Before the project page is created, you must provide a name and a subtitle containing for your project:

The RSD will automatically generate a *slug* for your project based on the project name you have provided. This slug will become part of the URL on which your project page can found. 
There is a small chance the generated slug is already in use by another project. If this is the case, an error will be show and you will need to change the slug resolve this conflict. 

::: warning
After you save the project page the slug can no longer be changed! You can still change the title or subtitle of the project however. 
::: 

Once you click "save" the RSD will initialize a new empty project page. It will not be public yet, to give you some time to provide additional information.
Next, you can add additional information in the 7 sections explained below. 

## Basic information

On this page, you can add and change the basic information about the project. This includes: 

- The title of the project
- A subtitle (which briefly explains the topic).
- An image illustrating the topic or goal of the project
- A description of the project (written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org)).

In addition, the sidebar on the right shows: 

- The publication status 
- A start and end date
- A grant ID
- The funding organization(s) as listed in the RSD or the [ROR database](https://ror.org)
- A list of relevant URLs (such as a project web page, github organization, etc.)
- The research domain(s) or this project (as defined by the [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/news/new-erc-panel-structure-2021-and-2022))
- Keywords for this project

While entering this information, any changes you make are stored automatically. You can view the resulting page by clicking *view page* in the top right corner. 
Click the pencil icon in the top right to get back to the editing view.

## Team information

![image](/project-team-information.gif)

On this page, you can add team members to the project. Using the search bar on the left, you can search for persons registered in the RSD and [ORCID](https://orcid.org) databases 
using their name or ORCID. To add a team member, select the person from the drop down list with search results, or select "Add Name" to manually add a person if no information 
is found in the RSD or ORCID. 

Next, a pop up appears with the information available on this team member:

You can correct the available information and add any missing fields before adding this person to the team. The information stored about each team member is specific to this 
project. Therefore, you can safely change information about this person without this having an effect on any other project the person is involved in. 

::: danger
When manually adding team members, please ensure you have **persmission** to share their information on the project pages!
