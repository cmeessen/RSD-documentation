# Getting Started

The Research Software Directory can be found at: 

[https://research-software-directory.org/](https://research-software-directory.org/)

On this page, you will find links to the [research software](https://research-software-directory.org/software) recorded in the RSD, the 
[research projects](https://research-software-directory.org/projects) in which this software was used or developed, and the 
[organizations](https://research-software-directory.org/organizations) who contributed to this software. 

All information recorded in the RSD about software, projects and organizations is public, since our goal is to promote the visibility, 
impact and reuse of research software. Anyone can browse through this information and it is indexed by search engines.  

## Signing in 

To add information to the RSD, you must first sign in to the platform. At the moment we support a single identity provider:

* [SurfConext](https://www.surf.nl/en/surfconext-global-access-with-1-set-of-credentials) 
 
We plan to increase the set of identity providers in the near future.

To sign in, go to the "sign in" button at the top right corner of the page, select your identity provider, and enter your credentials:

If you sign in to the RSD for the first time, your identify provider may ask you permission to share information with the RSD. 

## Signing out

To sign out, you can use the profile button the top right corner of the page and select "sign-out".
