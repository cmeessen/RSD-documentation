To create a new software page, you must provide a name for your software and a short description of what it does. Once you click "save" the RSD will use this information to initialize a new empty software page. It will not be public yet, to give you some time to provide additional information.

Next, you can add additional information in the 7 sections explained below. 

## Software information

In this section you can provide the basic information about the software, namely: 

- A URL for the main webpage of the software. This link will show up as the "Get started" button on the software page. 
- A URL for source code repository of the software. This link will show up as a repository icon on the software page and will be used to harvest information about the software development activity, which will be shown as a graph. At the moment we support [github](), [gitlab]() and have limited support for [bitbucket](). 
- A more extensive description of the software, which will be shown on the software page. You can use markdown to write this description, or import an existing markdown file from the web.
- A concept DOI for the archived releases of the software. This concept DOI will be used to automatically detect new releases of your software, and generate the block with citation information shown on the software page. You can find more information on concept DOIs and how to create them [here]().
- Keywords describing the software. These will be shown in the sidebar of the software page. If you have provided a concept DOI, the keywords can also be imported from the archive metadata. 
- The license of the software. This will be shown in the sidebar of the software page. If you have provided a concept DOI, the keywords can also be imported from the archive metadata.
